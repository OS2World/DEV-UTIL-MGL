Things to be added to library:
------------------------------

Linked lists, queues, dlists and deques in contiguous memory with links
specified as integer indexes.

Binary Tree class (simple)
AVL tree class for balanced binary trees
Red Black trees
Skip Lists
Splay Trees
Heap class
    Binomial Heaps
    Fibonacci Heaps
Priority Queue class
Bit oriented sets
    character sets
Date class
Time class
B-Tree's
B*-Tree's

Notes:
------

Both AVL trees and Red/Black trees should be able to be coded as extensions
to a standard binary tree representation.

Enhancements:
-------------

Hash Tables:
    - Modify the hash table routines to return both the size and load
      factor for the hash table (load factor should be an integer).

    - Provide a routine for searching for a GOOD hash table size given an
      expected number of items to be stored in the array.

Things to be noted:
-------------------

No memory exception handling is performed by the library. It is assumed that
the user will provide a memory handling routine via the set_new_handler
function or by using C++ exceptions.
