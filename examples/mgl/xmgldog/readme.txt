                     * MGL Sample Program:  XMGLDOG *
                     ********************************

Supported environments:
    Unix/X11

Color depths supported:
    Any X11 display depth

Interface:
    X-Window (raw Xlib) program.

Description:
    This sample program is a simple program showing how you can use the
    MGL for displaying transparent bitmaps for sprite and animation
    effects. It is loosely based on the WinG DOGGIE sample program,
    but full supports all color depths and resolutions. This version is
    similar to the fullscreen version but displays all data in a window
    on the desktop.

    This sample is a good place to get information on how to load bitmaps,
    convert them to the color format of the display, allowing for
    maximum performance when blitting the bitmaps to the screen.
