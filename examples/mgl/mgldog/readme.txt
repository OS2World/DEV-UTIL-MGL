                     ********************************

    32 bit DOS protected mode
    32 bit Windows

Color depths supported:
    All.

    Command line for DOS, Dialog Box for Windows.

Description:
    This sample program is a simple program showing how you can use the
    MGL for displaying transparent bitmaps for sprite and animation
    effects. It is loosely based on the WinG DOGGIE sample program,
    but full supports all color depths and resolutions.

    This sample is a good place to get information on how to load bitmaps,
    convert them to the color format of the display, allowing for
    maximum performance when blitting the bitmaps to the screen.
