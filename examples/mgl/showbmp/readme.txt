Description:
    This sample program is a simple program showing how you can use the
    MGL to load and display Windows BMP bitmap files with the MGL. This
    program will load and display bitmaps in any color depth, including
    HiColor and TrueColor bitmaps. For HiColor and TrueColor bitmaps,
    autmatic dithering is performed to display the bitmaps in 8 bits
    per pixel modes.

    This sample is a good place to get information on how to load bitmaps
    directly into a device context, with automatic color conversion
    during loading.


NOTE!!
    The pre-built demo versions of this program uses the SciTech
    Software UVBELib linkable device support libraries. These libraries
    contain a linkable version of the device support provided by
    our SciTech Display Doctor retail package, and are available for
    licensing from SciTech Software.

    Note that the MGL provides direct support for the VBE 1.2, VBE 2.0
    and VBE/AF specifications. For more information on the UVBELib
