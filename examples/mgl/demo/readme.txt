Description:
    This sample program is a full featured 2D demo program for the MGL.
    It uses the MegaVision C++ GUI Class Library to provide a full
    windowing system. The program shows how you can use the MegaVision
    and the MGL to allow the user to change color depths and resolutions
    on the fly. It also contains demonstration code showing off all the
    different types of 2D primitives that the MGL provides.
