                     * MGL Sample Program: WSHOWBMP *
                     ********************************

Supported environments:
    32 bit Windows

Color depths supported:
    Any Windows color depth.

Interface:
    Windows program.

Description:
    This sample program is a simple program showing how you can use the
    MGL to load and display Windows BMP bitmap files with the MGL. This
    program will load and display bitmaps in any color depth, including
    HiColor and TrueColor bitmaps. For HiColor and TrueColor bitmaps,
    autmatic dithering is performed to display the bitmaps in 8 bits
    per pixel modes. This version is similar to the fullscreen version,
    but all output is displayed in a window on the desktop, and also
    includes an option to stretch the bitmap data fullscreen.

    This sample is a good place to get information on how to load bitmaps
    directly into a device context, with automatic color conversion
    during loading.

    It is also a useful sample for learning how to deal with color palettes
    in the MGL and making them work for you within the constraints of
    Windows.
